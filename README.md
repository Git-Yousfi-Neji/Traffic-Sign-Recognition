# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
The goal of this reop is design an image processing algorithm that can determine the type of the traffic sign that is displayed in an image, and is robust to different real-life conditions such as poor lighting, obstructions or the sign being far away.

Steps to run:

1)Install all the dependencies
Tensorflow,Keras,Numpy,Pandas,Pickle,Matplotlib

2)Run the ipython notebook file: traffic_sign_classification_TRAINING_CODE.ipynb using jupyter notebook

For testing:
Run the ipython notebook file: traffic_sign_classification_TESTING_CODE.ipynb using jupyter notebook
